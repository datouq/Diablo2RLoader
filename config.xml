	<!--This enables the script to match a config file (settings.json) to the account you are launching. 
	Eg if using account 1, this is achieved by overwriting settings.json with settings1.json.
	Due to this, if enabled, settings1.json,settins2.json etc will not be updated if you update your game settings.
	As such	you will need to manually update your settings.json config file, see readme for more details. -->
